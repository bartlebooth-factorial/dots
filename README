A repository for my personal configurations/dotfiles.

Note that the directories included in this repo are copied from my system
and pruned of all contents that aren't the intended config file
(for example, my real .emacs.d directory has more than just "init.el" in it,
but this repo includes only init.el). This means that some of my config files
may not work when freshly cloned, because they may try to look for a plugin or
source a file that isn't there.

The directories for suckless programs (dwm, dmenu, etc) are included without
the patches that I applied to them, but since the patches change the source files,
you should be able to compile them without any issues.
