A repository for my personal configuration/dotfiles.

Note that the dot-dirs included in this repo are copied from my system
and pruned of all contents that aren't the intended config file
(for example, my real .emacs.d directory has more than just init.el in it,
but this repo includes only init.el). This means that some of my config files
may not work when freshly cloned, because they may try to source a file at runtime that isn't there.

The directories for suckless programs (dwm, dmenu, etc.) are included as-is,
with the diff files for my applied patches (for clarity, not needed for compilation),
meaning that they should compile and run with no issues. dwm is the only one of these
for which I've written custom functions into the source code, so for the rest of the suckless
suite the patches and config.h should tell the whole story.

TODO: add documentation for some specific configs (vim, emacs, dwm) into the readme
